### 2 Drawings ![Progress](https://us-central1-una-fiesta-bonita-1.cloudfunctions.net/progress/0)
Ok, last year I just got 1 here, let's try with 2 now.

### 1000 Github contributions ![Progress](https://us-central1-una-fiesta-bonita-1.cloudfunctions.net/progress/64)
This doesn't mean too much but I will track it again just for fun. I didn't make it last year, not even the half of it, but I will keep the bar high here. I have plans to contribute more to the Open Source world. And here is [a nice UI][githubui] just to track this.

### 5 blog posts
Las year I completely forgot about this one (too busy?), let's try again.

### 1 Trip outside the country ![Progress](https://us-central1-una-fiesta-bonita-1.cloudfunctions.net/progress/400)
Ok, I just moved out of the country. I now live in Mexico, so I guess that counts.
Also, I traveled another 3 times this year.

### Weight 72,5 kg/160 lb
This one is hard, last year didn't make it. I never recovered my weight after my trip to Denver and I just moved to Mexico where there are a lot of delicious food options.
 - August 26, 2018: 83.3 kg
 - November 7, 2018: 82.2 kg
 - December 31, 2018: 83.4 kg (ouch)
