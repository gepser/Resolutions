### 10 Books
On 2018 I read 15 books but I felt like that was a little bit too much. I need more time for other things, so 10 books seems about right.

1. [The Everything Store](https://www.beek.io/libros/the-everything-store-jeff-bezos-and-the-age-of-amazon-81eb3c1a-5693-49bb-9042-0851bc16bac7)
2. [The leader who had no title](https://www.beek.io/libros/title)

4. [The Art of Invisibility](https://www.amazon.es/Art-Invisibility-Worlds-Teaches-Brother/dp/0316380504)

### 1000 Github contributions
This doesn't mean too much but I will track it again just for fun. I didn't make it last year but I did more than 60%, so I'll keep the bar high here. I have plans to contribute more to the Open Source world. And here is [a nice UI][githubui] just to track this.
