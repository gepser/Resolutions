I liked drawing a long time ago. I would like to start again so let's start with one.

Well, it is an easy one but [here it is][drawing1].

### 1000 Github contributions ![Progress](http://progressed.io/bar/36)
Here is the magic. I have many things I want to code.
Entrepreneurship coding, contributing at open source projects and coding for fun are Ok. Coding at work doesn't count.
Originally I thought about tracking days coding per year but it is easier to track just the number of contributions since Github has [a nice UI for this][githubui].
