# 2019 Resolutions
Just a convenient place to track my new year resolutions.

This are the 2019 resolutions, go [here if you want to take a look at the 2018 resolutions](/archive/resolutions2018.md).

### 1 Tech Product ![Progress](http://progressed.io/bar/0)
Ok, I'll go with this one for the first time. I want to build a web app, a mobile app or any kind of app.

### 10 Online courses ![Progress](http://progressed.io/bar/0)
2018 was a great year for learning new things by I couldn't take all the courses I wanted. I'll go for quality instead of quantity this time.

1. [Google Cloud Platform Fundamentals: Core Infrastructure](https://www.coursera.org/learn/gcp-fundamentals) - [Certificate](https://www.coursera.org/account/accomplishments/certificate/2VKMBDWN96T9)

#### In progress
[iOS Programming in 7 Days](https://learning.oreilly.com/videos/ios-programming-in/9781789135350)

### 10 Books ![Progress](http://progressed.io/bar/0)
On 2018 I read 15 books but I felt like that was a little bit too much. I need more time for other things, so 10 books seems about right.

1. [The Everything Store](https://www.beek.io/libros/the-everything-store-jeff-bezos-and-the-age-of-amazon-81eb3c1a-5693-49bb-9042-0851bc16bac7)

### 1000 Github contributions ![Progress](http://progressed.io/bar/17)
This doesn't mean too much but I will track it again just for fun. I didn't make it last year but I did more than 60%, so I'll keep the bar high here. I have plans to contribute more to the Open Source world. And here is [a nice UI][githubui] just to track this.

### 4 blog posts ![Progress](http://progressed.io/bar/25)
Las year I tried this one but all I got was one internal post. This year I'll try again at least with one post a quarter.

1. [¿Qué es el Technical Debt?](https://medium.com/beek-tech/qu%C3%A9-es-el-technical-debt-7c2a2ee19781)

### 1 Trip outside the country ![Progress](http://progressed.io/bar/0)
I'll keep this simple, just 1 trip, even when last year I traveled 4 times.

### 2 Drawings ![Progress](http://progressed.io/bar/0)
Last year I did not any progress here but I'd like to try again.

### Weight 72,5 kg/160 lb

 - December 31, 2018: 83.4 kg
