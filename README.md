# 2020 Resolutions
Just a convenient place to track my new year resolutions.

This are the 2020 resolutions, go [here if you want to take a look at the 2019 resolutions](/archive/resolutions2019.md).

### Go deep in 2 topics
Let's change the way I was doing this. Instead of books and courses, I'll track progress in topics I already know something but want to go deep down on them. Let's give it a try!

#### Ruby
- Ruby on Rails
- Performance
- Security

#### Infrastructure
- CI/CD
- Security
- Cloud Arquitecture

### 4 blog posts
Ok, only one post last year. Let's give it another try.

### 1 Tech Product
Ok, I'll go with this one for the second time. I want to build a web app or a mobile app... or maybe a game?

### 1000 Github contributions
This doesn't mean too much but I will track it again just for fun. I didn't make it last year but I did more than 80%, so I'll keep the bar high here. I still have plans to contribute more to the Open Source world. And here is [a nice UI][githubui] just to track this.
